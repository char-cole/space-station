        <li>The ISS is orbiting the Earth at about 4.76 miles per second, or over 17,000 mph.</li>

        <li>Maintaining an average altitude of only about 250 miles above sea-level, the ISS is considered to be in low earth orbit. Most satellites are much farther out.</li>

        <li>The ISS is therefore able to make a complete orbit of the earth in about 92 minutes.</li>

        <li>Because it is so close to the Earth, the station is constantly being slowed down by friction from the upper atmosphere. If the station didn't have rockets to frequently accelerate forward, it would eventually fall low enough to burn up in the atmosphere.</li>

        <li>Gravity on the ISS is actually about 90% as strong as gravity at sea level. But because an object in orbit is in constant freefall, astronauts feel weightless while onboard the space station.</li>
